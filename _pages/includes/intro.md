I obtained my master's degree from the **School of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, Nantong University**, where my research focused on **Large Language Models for Software Engineering (LLM4SE)**, with an emphasis on **vulnerability detection**, under the supervision of [**Prof. Xiaolin Ju**](https://ntu-juking.github.io/)(鞠小林) and [**Prof. Xiang Chen**](https://xchencs.github.io/)(陈翔).

In addition, I interned at **Baidu**, **HiThink Research**, and **INF**, where my work centered around **large language models**, including their **application**, **training**, and **evaluation**.

My research interests include Software Engineering and Large Language Models. 
I have published 8 papers at the international Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence conferences/journal. 
These works have received a total of [![Google Scholar](https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Scholar-171%20citations-blue?logo=google-scholar)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uaEXxPgAAAAJ) on Google Scholar.
